## Type this in the console:

```javascript
node // this enables javascipt to be ran in the console

const name = 'JavaScript'; // This refers to a constant. The variable 'name' is now known as 'JavaScript'
console.log('Hello, ' + name); // This logs into the console "Hello, ' + name which, in this case, is 'JavaScript')

// Thus, the output expected in the console is:
// Hello, JavaScript

```
This is the basics of running JavaScript, similar to printing "Hello, World!" in a language like Ruby.
